<body>
This package contains an integration of JSR303 bean validation into
Wicket.

<p>First we must configure the validation for our Wicket
	application:
<pre>
public class MyApplication extends WebApplication {
	@Override
	protected void init()
	{
		super.init();

		// create a configuration
		ValidationConfiguration conf = new ValidationConfiguration();
		
		// tweak the configuration
		
		// bind the configuration to the application
		conf.configure(this);
	}
}		
</pre>

Once the application is configured we can begin validating fields:
<pre>
TextField field=new TextField(...);
field.add(new PropertyValidator(new SimpleProperty(Person.class, "name")));
</pre>

Or if we are using a PropertyModel, or a CompoundPropertyModel, or any
model that implements IPropertyReflectionAwareModel there is no need to
tell the validator what property it is bound to, it can figure it out
itself:

<pre>
TextField field=new TextField(...);
field.add(new PropertyValidator());
</pre>


To validate class-level constraints we must use ValidationForm and give
it the bean as its model:
<pre>
Form form = new ValidationForm("form", model);
TextField field=new TextField(...);
field.add(new PropertyValidator(new SimpleProperty(Person.class, "name")));
form.add(field);
</pre>

Once the form is submitted form.getModelObject() will be validated.

ValidationForm can also add PropertyValidators to its FormComponents
automatically so we dont have to, but once again we need to use one of
the supported models:

<pre>
IModel model = CompoundPropertyModel.of(bean);
Form form = new ValidationForm("form", model);
form.add(new TextField("name"));
</pre>

In the above example the "name" TextField will have a PropertyValidator
added to it automatically.
